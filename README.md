Your MySQL database should be named: cr13_bigevents_yourName

You will need to implement this project using Symfony!

 

For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded:

(20) Create a nice looking responsive theme. You can use Bootstrap or just HTML/CSS. 

Implement interface for the CRUD on Events:

(20) Event index page: all events should be listed here like on the image above (event name, event date and time)

(20) Event view page: when a user clicks on the event, he/she should get an event view page with all the data stored for that event

(15) Event edit page: on this page, it should be possible to edit the event data

(15) Event add page: on this page, it should be possible to add a new event

(10) Event delete option: a user should be able to delete an event from the database

Bonus Points:

(20) Create filtering depending on the event type (hint: pass the information to the URL)
